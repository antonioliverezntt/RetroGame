# 🧬 Viral Messiah – Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> *A retro bio-horror satire where you are the cure.*

---

## 1. Game Summary

**Viral Messiah** is a twisted reimagining of the classic *Snake* arcade formula. You play as an alien virus sent to Earth to save the planet — by eradicating humanity from the inside out. Guide your viral body through the circulatory, nervous, and cerebral systems of various despicable human hosts. Devour white blood cells, mutate grotesquely, and try not to implode before the host does.

It’s fast, irreverent, and dripping in satire. Built for short runs and dark laughs.

> *"They spend their lives consuming everything around them. We're just here to return the favor."*

### Core Ingredients:
- Snake mechanics with mutations
- Satirical narrative and hosts
- Procedurally generated body systems
- Host thoughts, viral dialogue, ironic death screens
- Web-based, playable on desktop and mobile
