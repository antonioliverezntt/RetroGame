- [ ] Replace "food" with "white blood cells"

### 2.3 Audio Foundation
- [ ] Add basic sound effects (consume, death, ambient)
- [ ] Background audio for biological atmosphere

**Deliverable**: Visually themed viral infection snake game with narrative context

---

## Phase 3: Mutation System & Core Parasight Mechanics
*Goal: Implement the unique mutation/evolution mechanics*

### 3.1 Mutation Framework
- [ ] Create mutation selection UI (choose 1 of 3)
- [ ] Implement mutation trigger system (score/level thresholds)
- [ ] Build mutation effect system architecture
- [ ] Add visual indicators for active mutations

### 3.2 Level 1 Mutations (Circulatory System)
- [ ] "Spine Fangs" - consume cells from behind
- [ ] "Leech Loop" - regain health from tail collisions
- [ ] "Capillary Phase" - temporary wall phasing
- [ ] Mutation description system with dark humor

### 3.3 Enhanced Mechanics
- [ ] Blood flow drift effect (subtle current simulation)
- [ ] Cholesterol clump obstacles (static barriers)
- [ ] Hemorrhagic burst power-up system
- [ ] Speed progression per level

**Deliverable**: Snake game with working mutation system and enhanced circulatory level

---

## Phase 4: Multi-Level Progression
*Goal: Implement all three body systems with unique mechanics*

### 4.1 Level System Architecture
- [ ] Level progression triggers
- [ ] Level-specific background/visual themes
- [ ] Difficulty scaling between levels
- [ ] Save/restore level progress within session

### 4.2 Level 2: Nervous System
- [ ] Blue/purple neuron visual theme
- [ ] Impulse pulse mechanics (electrical surges)
- [ ] Neural interference (movement delays)
- [ ] Antibody drone enemies
- [ ] Cortical scrambler power-up
- [ ] Level 2 specific mutations

### 4.3 Level 3: Brain System
- [ ] Abstract maze-like environment
- [ ] Thought spawn obstacles with text
- [ ] Auto-tracking microdrone enemies
- [ ] Neuroplasticity (shifting maze)
- [ ] Existential reset power-up
- [ ] Final level mutations

**Deliverable**: Three complete levels with unique mechanics and progression

---

## Phase 5: Host Variety & Advanced Features
*Goal: Add replay value and polish*

### 5.1 Multiple Hosts
- [ ] Implement host selection/randomization
- [ ] Add remaining hosts: Greg C., Tiffany L., Rat Kings
- [ ] Host-specific thought bubbles
- [ ] Host-specific environmental elements
- [ ] Host-specific mutation preferences

### 5.2 Advanced Mechanics
- [ ] Enemy AI improvements (tracking, behavior patterns)
- [ ] Advanced power-up system
- [ ] Special virus abilities per level
- [ ] Environmental hazards and interactables

### 5.3 Progression & Polish
- [ ] Unlock system for hosts/mutations
- [ ] High score tracking (session-based)
- [ ] Enhanced visual effects and animations
- [ ] Game balance tuning

**Deliverable**: Full-featured game with multiple hosts and advanced mechanics

---

## Phase 6: Mobile Optimization & Final Polish
*Goal: Complete, polished web game experience*

### 6.1 Mobile Controls
- [ ] Touch/swipe input system
- [ ] Mobile-responsive UI scaling
- [ ] Touch-friendly mutation selection
- [ ] Performance optimization for mobile

### 6.2 Final Polish
- [ ] Complete visual effect system
- [ ] Enhanced audio design
- [ ] Loading screens and transitions
- [ ] Error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization (<30MB target)

### 6.3 Deploy & Test
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Final bug fixes and polish

**Deliverable**: Production-ready Alienesis game

## Development Guidelines

### LLM Assistance Strategy
- **One Phase at a Time**: Complete each phase before moving to next
- **Incremental Testing**: Test each feature immediately after implementation
- **Component Isolation**: Build modular, reusable components
- **Clear Success Criteria**: Each task should have testable outcome

### Technical Considerations
- Use TypeScript for better LLM code generation
- Modular component architecture for easier iteration
- Responsive design from the start
- Performance monitoring throughout development
- Clean, documented code for easier debugging

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing after each feature
- Browser compatibility checks at each phase
- Mobile testing starting from Phase 2
- Performance profiling in Phase 5+

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: Foundation and theming (2-3 development sessions)
- **Phase 3**: Mutation system (2 sessions)  
- **Phase 4**: Multi-level implementation (3-4 sessions)
- **Phase 5**: Host variety and advanced features (2-3 sessions)
- **Phase 6**: Mobile optimization and polish (1-2 sessions)

**Total**: ~10-15 focused development sessions for complete MVP

*Note: This plan prioritizes working gameplay over perfect implementation. Each phase should result in a playable experience that can be tested and refined.*
